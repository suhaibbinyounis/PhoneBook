# PhoneBook
PhoneBook using python3 and tkinter

You need my mysql.connector and tkinter modules for this to work.
This project uses database 'phonebook' and table 'phbook'.
'phbook' has two columns (Name varchar(30),Phone varchar(30))

It has features like loading contacts, adding contacts and deleting contacts.
